## Overview

Please replace this with a real description!

## Development

This project is developed using Nix, although it isn't strictly required. It
will, however, significantly help with keeping development environments
consistent between developers, CI, and so forth. To get started with Nix, follow
[this guide][nix] to get Nix itself running (if you're not on NixOS), and then
[this one][nix-direnv] to set up `nix-direnv` (if you're not using NixOS, then
you'll want to follow the "With nix-env" section's instructions).
